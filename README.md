  Summary
</h2>

<p align="center">
  By doing this exercise, I was able to get familiar with and practice SQL queries. I used SELECT to specify which data I wanted to gather and from what columns (* meaning all columns). FROM was used to select the table. With WHERE I could filter and make the data easier to read. AND, OR, and NOT were used to build upon the WHERE filter.
